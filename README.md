# Dev_Setup
Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11

2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.

5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html

7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 

#Deliverables:
- Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.
- A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).
- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.

#Submission:
Submit your document and GitHub repository link through the designated platform or email to the instructor by the specified deadline.

#Evaluation Criteria:**
- Completeness and accuracy of setup documentation.
- Effectiveness of version control implementation.
- Appropriateness of tools selected for the project requirements.
- Clarity of reflection on challenges and solutions encountered.
- Adherence to submission guidelines and deadlines.

Note: Feel free to reach out for clarification or assistance with any aspect of the assignment.




Title: Environment Setup Documentation
Introduction
This document outlines the steps taken to set up a developer environment, including configurations, customizations, and troubleshooting steps encountered during the process.It details the steps that were taken to install and configure the necessary software tools including Windows 10, Visual Studio Code,Git,Python , and MySQL.
Operating System Installation: Windows 11
Installation Steps
Download: Accessed the https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11 and selected the appropriate version for my system.
Installation: Executed the installation file and followed the on-screen instructions, choosing default settings for most options.
Configuration: I set up user accounts and system preferences after installation.
IDE Setup: Visual Studio Code
Installation Steps
Download: Visited the Visual Studio Code download page and downloaded the installer for Windows.
Installation: Ran the installer and followed the prompts to complete the installation.
Verification: Launched Visual Studio Code to ensure it was installed correctly.
Version Control System: Git and GitHub
Setup Steps
Git Installation: Downloaded and installed Git from Git SCM.
GitHub Account Creation: Signed up for a new account at GitHub.
Repository Initialization: Initialized a Git repository in my project directory and made the first commit.
Programming Language: Python
Installation Steps
Download: Obtained the latest version of Python(i.e 3.12.2) from Python.org.
Installation: Installed Python, ensuring to add it to the PATH.
Verification: Checked the installation by running python --version in the command prompt.
Database Setup: MySQL
Installation Steps
Download: Downloaded the MySQL installer from MySQL Downloads.
Installation: Installed MySQL using the installer, setting up the root password and other configurations as prompted.
Troubleshooting Encountered
Node.js PATH Issue: Initially, Node.js was not recognized in the terminal. Resolved by adding the correct PATH in .bash_profile.
VS Code Python Interpreter: Had issues with selecting the Python interpreter. Resolved by specifying the path to the Python executable in VS Code settings.
Docker Permissions: Encountered permissions errors when running Docker. Fixed by adding the user to the Docker group with sudo usermod -aG docker $USER and restarting the system


Reflection on Challenges and Solutions
During the setup, I encountered a few challenges:
Windows 11 Installation: Initially faced issues with compatibility; resolved by updating my device drivers.
Python  Configuration: Had difficulties setting up Python configurations; resolved by referring to online forums and documentation
